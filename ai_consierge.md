At **3d7 Technologies**, our **AI Concierge Service** provides a premium, hands-on consulting engagement where our team of AI specialists designs, builds, and deploys a custom personal AI assistant ecosystem tailored to busy executives, founders, and high-achieving professionals. This bespoke service bridges the gap between powerful frontier AI tools (such as advanced language models, agents, and no-code/low-code platforms) and real-world productivity, without requiring you to become an expert yourself.

The service focuses on creating a secure, integrated, and evolving digital assistant that automates repetitive tasks, enhances decision-making, and reclaims significant time each week—delivering measurable ROI quickly.

### Core Services Offered

We structure the offering around a phased, high-touch approach. The initial setup is the flagship deliverable, with optional ongoing layers for sustained value.

1. **Discovery & Workflow Mapping Workshop**  
   - In-depth 2–4 hour session (in-person where feasible, or secure remote via screen-share/collaboration tools).  
   - We audit your current daily/weekly routines, tools stack (e.g., email like Gmail/Outlook, calendar, CRM such as Salesforce/HubSpot, Notion/Airtable, Slack/Teams, Google Workspace/Microsoft 365, etc.), pain points, goals, and key performance metrics.  
   - Output: A prioritized workflow map highlighting high-impact automation opportunities (e.g., email triage, meeting prep, research aggregation, follow-up automation).

2. **Custom AI Assistant Architecture & Build**  
   - Design and implementation of one or more tailored AI agents/assistants using frontier models (e.g., Grok, Claude, GPT-series) combined with no-code/low-code orchestration tools (e.g., Zapier, Make.com, n8n, LangChain-inspired setups, or custom wrappers where needed).  
   - Core capabilities built include:  
     - **Email & Communication Management** — Auto-summarize inboxes, draft replies, prioritize messages, flag action items.  
     - **Calendar & Scheduling Optimization** — Intelligent booking, conflict resolution, focus-time blocking, prep briefs for meetings.  
     - **Research & Knowledge Aggregation** — Pull insights from web/tools, summarize reports/articles, compile decision briefs.  
     - **Task & Project Automation** — Create/update tasks in tools like Todoist/Notion/Trello, generate follow-ups, track progress.  
     - **Content & Output Generation** — Draft emails, LinkedIn posts, reports, proposals based on your style/voice.  
     - **Decision Support** — Analyze data (e.g., sales figures, market trends), provide scenario recommendations.  
     - **Personal Productivity Boosts** — Daily digests, habit tracking reminders, wellness integrations if desired.  
   - All agents are configured with your preferred tone, confidentiality rules, and escalation paths (e.g., flag complex items for human review).

3. **Secure Integrations & Data Pipeline Setup**  
   - Build compliant, encrypted connections to your data sources using OAuth/API keys (no unsafe scraping or storage).  
   - Emphasis on privacy: GDPR-aligned practices, minimal data retention, role-based access, audit logs where applicable.  
   - Test end-to-end flows to ensure reliability and security.

4. **Hands-On Training & Empowerment Session**  
   - 1–2 hour walkthrough where we demonstrate usage, teach basic tweaks (e.g., updating prompts, adding new triggers), and share a custom "operating manual" (Notion doc or similar).  
   - Goal: You and your team gain confidence to maintain and expand independently.

5. **Testing, Iteration & Launch**  
   - Rigorous testing with real scenarios (we run shadow mode first if preferred).  
   - Final optimizations based on initial feedback.  
   - Smooth handover with monitoring setup for the first 7–14 days.

6. **Optional Ongoing Maintenance & Evolution Retainer**  
   - Proactive monthly/quarterly updates as AI models advance (new features/capabilities drop frequently).  
   - Performance monitoring, additional agent builds, prompt refinement, new tool integrations.  
   - Priority support for questions or expansions.

### How We Deliver the Service (Step-by-Step Process)

1. **Initial Contact & Qualification**  
   - 15-minute discovery call to confirm fit (your goals, current tools, scope).

2. **Proposal & Agreement**  
   - Customized scope document with pricing (£2,500–£4,000 for initial setup based on complexity—e.g., number of integrations, agent count, depth).  
   - Signed engagement and deposit.

3. **Kickoff & Discovery (Week 1)**  
   - Schedule workshop; gather access (read-only where possible).

4. **Build Phase (Weeks 1–3)**  
   - Architecture design → Prototyping → Full implementation.  
   - Regular check-ins (1–2 brief calls/updates).

5. **Training & Go-Live (Week 3–4)**  
   - Final session + 2-week support window for tweaks.

6. **Ongoing (If Chosen)**  
   - Monthly retainer activates post-launch; billed separately.

This service is deliberately selective—we cap at 5–8 clients per month to maintain white-glove quality and ensure every deployment delivers transformative results rather than generic setups.
